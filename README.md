# Customer-Purchase-Anaysis-Dashboard
This Tableau dashboard utilizes 12-month customer-sales data to analyze sales metrics, demographic trends, and geographical demand in the USA. It features various chart types, including bar, donut, and geo-spatial maps, to present an overview of sales, highlight high-demand regions, and explore customer purchase patterns by age and gender. The dashboard also examines sales revenue by categories and the impact of discounts on customer behavior. Tools used include Tableau for visualization and data transformation, with data sourced from a large sales dataset and US state mappings for geographical representation.

Goals
1. Overview of all the sales metrics highlighting total orders, total sales etc.
2. Since this data has only USA demographics, I used a geo-spatial chart to highlight areas with strong demand and other areas with more opportunities.
3. I also presented the customer purchase pattern for different demographics like age and gender.
4. Help to understand the customer demand throughout the year and drill down to specific months.
5. Sales revenue coming from different categories.
6. Impact of discount on customer behavior.
Tools and dataset -
Tools-
For this exercise, I mainly used Tableau with some data transformation inside the tableau using calculated fields..
Dataset -
For this exercise, I used two datasets -
1- “sales_06_FY2020-21.csv”, since the data was very big so I chose only 100K records.
2- US states mapping , for grid formation, so that I can represent each state without overlapping with each other.

 Dashboard -
Here is the screenshot of the full dashboard. In the next sections we will explore each individual chart and their corresponding details. Throughout the chart I used following Gestalt’s principles

● Principle of Similarity and Proximity (bubble chart)

● Principle of Continuity (bar chart)

● Principle of Focal point (each item in the dashboard have the selection feature)
